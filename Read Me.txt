Step 1: Connect to the Internet

In order to send emails using the software, you must first ensure that your device is connected to the Internet.
Check your device’s network settings to confirm that you are connected to a Wi-Fi or cellular data network.

Step 2: Prepare the Excel file

The Excel file that you upload to the software must contain a column named “email” (Case Sensitive).
This column should contain the email addresses of the recipients to whom you want to send emails.

Step 3: Use your Google App Password

When using the software to send emails through your Gmail account, you must use your Google App Password instead of your regular Gmail password.
This is because Google discontinued support for third-party applications to send emails using regular Gmail passwords in 2021.
